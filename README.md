Users get to pick a deal for the favorite outlet present in
Syracuse: restaurants, spa & salon, fabulous deals, or things to do. Buyers seal the deal
and obtain a unique code to avail the offer. The code is shared with the respective
retailer during the time of purchase of that actual product.
 Once an offer is availed, the details of that particular offer is present in the “my
 bookings” page which can be accessed by that user.
Greedy Picks doesn’t work like Groupon (where a product is offered at a cheaper rate,
provided there are a minimum number of customers who would purchase that product).
 The app is currently designed for merchants in and around Syracuse. The novelty of this
 app is that we do not focus only on large scale vendors, but also focus on local
 merchants and assist them in boosting their businesses.
